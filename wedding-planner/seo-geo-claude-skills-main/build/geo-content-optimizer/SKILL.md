   **Authoritative**
   - From recognized experts or trusted sources
   - Contains proper citations and references

   - Has standalone statements that answer questions
   - Contains specific facts, statistics, and data
   - Includes memorable, concise explanations
   ```

2. **Analyze Current Content**

   ```markdown
   ## GEO Analysis: [Content Title]
   
   ### Current State Assessment
   
   | Factor | Score | Notes |
   |--------|-------|-------|
   | Clear definitions | [1-5] | [notes] |
   | Quotable statements | [1-5] | [notes] |
   | Factual density | [1-5] | [notes] |

   | Authority signals | [1-5] | [notes] |
   | Content freshness | [1-5] | [notes] |
   | Structure clarity | [1-5] | [notes] |
   
   **Overall GEO Score**: [X]/40
   
   **Primary Weaknesses**:
   1. [Weakness 1]
   2. [Weakness 2]
   3. [Weakness 3]
   
   **Quick Wins**:
   1. [Quick improvement 1]
   2. [Quick improvement 2]
   ```

3. **Optimize for Clear Definitions**

   AI systems love clear, quotable definitions.

   ```markdown
   ### Definition Optimization
   
   **Before** (Weak for GEO):
   > SEO is really important for businesses and involves various 
   > techniques to improve visibility online through search engines.
   
   **After** (Strong for GEO):
   > **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** is the practice of optimizing 
   > websites and content to rank higher in search engine results pages 
   > (SERPs), increasing organic traffic and visibility.
   
   **Definition Template**:
   "[Term] is [clear category/classification] that [primary function/purpose], 
   [key characteristic or benefit]."
   
   **Checklist for GEO-Optimized Definitions**:
   - [ ] Starts with the term being defined
   - [ ] Provides clear category (what type of thing it is)
   - [ ] Explains primary function or purpose
   - [ ] Uses precise, unambiguous language
   - [ ] Can stand alone as a complete answer
   - [ ] Is 25-50 words for optimal citation length
   ```

4. **Create Quotable Statements**

   ```markdown
   ### Quotable Statement Optimization
   
   AI systems cite specific, standalone statements. Transform vague 
   content into quotable facts.
   
   **Weak (Not quotable)**:
   > Email marketing is pretty effective and lots of companies use it.
   
   **Strong (Quotable)**:
   > Email marketing delivers an average ROI of $42 for every $1 spent, 
   > making it one of the highest-performing digital marketing channels.
   
   **Types of Quotable Statements**:
   
   1. **Statistics**
      - Include specific numbers
      - Cite the source
      - Add context (timeframe, comparison)
      
      Example: "According to [Source], [specific statistic] as of [date]."
   
   2. **Facts**
      - Verifiable information
      - Unambiguous language
      - Authoritative source
      
      Example: "[Subject] was [fact], according to [authoritative source]."
   
   3. **Definitions** (covered above)
   
   4. **Comparisons**
      - Clear comparison structure
      - Specific differentiators
      
      Example: "Unlike [A], [B] [specific difference], which means [implication]."
   
   5. **How-to Steps**
      - Numbered, clear steps
      - Action-oriented language
      
      Example: "To [achieve goal], [step 1], then [step 2], and finally [step 3]."
   ```

5. **Add Authority Signals**

   ```markdown
   ### Authority Signal Enhancement
   
   **Expert Attribution**
   
   Add expert quotes and credentials:
   
   > "AI will transform how we search for information," says Dr. Jane Smith, 
   > AI Research Director at Stanford University.
   
   **Source Citations**
   
   Properly cite sources that AI can verify:
   
   Before:
   > Studies show that most people prefer video content.
   
   After:
   > According to Wyzowl's 2024 Video Marketing Statistics report, 
   > 91% of consumers want to see more online video content from brands.
   
   **Authority Elements to Add**:
   - [ ] Author byline with credentials
   - [ ] Expert quotes with attribution
   - [ ] Citations to peer-reviewed research
   - [ ] References to recognized authorities
   - [ ] Original data or research
   - [ ] Case studies with named companies
   - [ ] Industry statistics with sources
   ```

6. **Optimize Content Structure**

   ```markdown
   ### Structure Optimization for GEO
   
   AI systems parse structured content more effectively.
   
   **Q&A Format**
   
   Transform content into question-answer pairs:
   
   ```html
   <h2>What is [Topic]?</h2>
   <p>[Direct answer in 40-60 words]</p>
   
   <h2>How does [Topic] work?</h2>
   <p>[Clear explanation with steps if applicable]</p>
   
   <h2>Why is [Topic] important?</h2>
   <p>[Specific reasons with evidence]</p>
   ```
   
   **Comparison Tables**
   
   For comparison queries, use clear tables:
   
   | Feature | Option A | Option B |
   |---------|----------|----------|
   | [Feature 1] | [Specific value] | [Specific value] |
   | [Feature 2] | [Specific value] | [Specific value] |
   | **Best for** | [Use case] | [Use case] |
   
   **Numbered Lists**
   
   For process or list queries:
   
   1. **Step 1: [Action]** - [Brief explanation]
   2. **Step 2: [Action]** - [Brief explanation]
   3. **Step 3: [Action]** - [Brief explanation]
   
   **Definition Boxes**
   
   Highlight key definitions:
   
   > **Key Definition**: [Term] refers to [clear definition].
   ```

7. **Enhance Factual Density**

   ```markdown
   ### Factual Density Improvement
   
   AI systems prefer fact-rich content over opinion-heavy content.
   
   **Content Transformation**:
   
   **Low factual density**:
   > Social media marketing is very popular nowadays. Many businesses 
   > use it and find it helpful for reaching customers.
   
   **High factual density**:
   > Social media marketing reaches 4.9 billion users globally (Statista, 2024). 
   > Businesses using social media marketing report 66% higher lead generation 
   > rates compared to non-users (HubSpot State of Marketing Report, 2024). 
   > The most effective platforms for B2B marketing are LinkedIn (96% usage), 
   > Twitter (82%), and Facebook (80%).
   
   **Factual Enhancement Checklist**:
   - [ ] Add specific statistics with sources
   - [ ] Include exact dates, numbers, percentages
   - [ ] Replace vague claims with verified facts
   - [ ] Add recent data (within last 2 years)
   - [ ] Include multiple data points per section
   - [ ] Cross-reference with authoritative sources
   ```

8. **Implement FAQ Schema**

   ```markdown
   ### FAQ Optimization for GEO
   
   FAQ sections are highly effective for GEO because:
   - They match question-based AI queries
   - They provide concise, structured answers
   - FAQ schema helps AI understand Q&A pairs

   ## Frequently Asked Questions

   [Supporting detail or example]
   
   ### [Question matching common query]?
