    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of a wedding at Taj Lake Palace?",
      "answer": "A wedding at Taj Lake Palace typically ranges from ₹2.5 crores to ₹5+ crores depending on guest count, season, and customizations. This includes venue rental, accommodation for 83 rooms, catering for all events, and basic décor. Peak season (October-March) commands 20-30% higher rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best time for a wedding at Taj Lake Palace?",
      "answer": "The ideal months for a wedding at Taj Lake Palace are October to March when Udaipur enjoys pleasant weather with temperatures between 15-25°C. November and February are most popular for outdoor ceremonies. Avoid monsoon season (July-September) when boat services may be affected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we have fireworks at Taj Lake Palace?",
      "answer": "Yes, fireworks displays over Lake Pichola are one of the signature experiences at Taj Lake Palace. The venue can arrange choreographed fireworks for your wedding night.

    {
      "question": "How far in advance should I book Taj Lake Palace for my wedding?",
      "answer": "For peak wedding season (October-March), we recommend booking 18-24 months in advance. The palace hosts only one wedding at a time for exclusivity, making prime dates extremely sought-after. For off-season bookings, 12 months advance notice is usually sufficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Taj Lake Palace unique for destination weddings?",
      "answer": "Taj Lake Palace is the only floating palace wedding venue in India. Built in 1746 as a royal summer palace, it offers an unmatched experience: guests arrive by boat, ceremonies take place surrounded by Lake Pichola, and the 360-degree water views create a magical, intimate atmosphere that no land-based venue can replicate."
    },

      "question": "Can elderly or wheelchair-bound guests attend weddings at Taj Lake Palace?",
      "answer": "Yes, Taj Lake Palace accommodates guests with mobility challenges. Boats are equipped for wheelchair access, and the palace has ramps and elevators for internal movement.
