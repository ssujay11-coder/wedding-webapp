    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How far in advance should we book Taj Lake Palace for a wedding?",
        "answer": "Due to the palace's limited capacity and extreme popularity, we recommend booking 18-24 months in advance for peak season dates (October-March). For full property buyouts, even earlier booking is advisable. The palace hosts very few weddings annually, making early planning essential."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the minimum stay requirement for wedding events?",
        "answer": "A minimum stay of 3 nights is typically required for wedding celebrations at Taj Lake Palace. For full property buyouts, which is recommended for weddings, the minimum may extend to 4 nights depending on the season. This allows adequate time for all ceremonies and ensures an unhurried experience."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many guests can be accommodated on the island?",
        "answer": "The Taj Lake Palace has 66 rooms and suites accommodating approximately 120-130 guests. Given the island's exclusive nature, all wedding guests should ideally stay on-property for the full experience. Overflow arrangements can be made at sister properties like Taj Fateh Prakash Palace on the mainland with boat transfers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a minimum food and beverage requirement?",
        "answer": "Yes, minimum F&B commitments apply and vary significantly based on season and whether it's a full property buyout. During peak season, minimums typically start from ₹35-50 lakhs for weddings. This includes all meals, beverage service, and catering for wedding functions. Custom proposals are provided based on guest count and event scale."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can we bring outside caterers to the island?",
        "answer": "Outside catering is not permitted due to the island's logistical constraints and the hotel's quality standards. The Taj culinary team is highly experienced in creating elaborate wedding menus including specific regional cuisines, family recipes, and dietary requirements. Specialty items may be accommodated with advance discussion."
      },
      {
        "question": "What decoration restrictions apply to the heritage palace?",
        "answer": "The palace's 18th-century heritage status requires strict decoration guidelines. No fixtures can be attached to marble surfaces, no naked flames in certain areas, and all materials must be fire-retardant. The hotel's decoration team specializes in creating stunning setups within these guidelines. External decorators must receive orientation on heritage protocols."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the music timing restrictions on the lake?",
        "answer": "Due to sound traveling across the lake, outdoor music is permitted until 10:00 PM. Indoor venues allow music until 10:30 PM. Traditional musicians and acoustic performances may continue slightly longer in designated areas. The intimate island setting creates magical ambiance even without amplified late-night music."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is drone photography permitted at the palace?",
        "answer": "Drone photography requires special permissions due to the heritage site status and proximity to City Palace. Requests must be submitted at least 30 days in advance. When approved, specific flight zones and timing restrictions apply. The hotel can recommend experienced drone operators familiar with local regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if there's unexpected rain during our wedding?",
        "answer": "The palace has beautiful indoor venues including Bada Mahal that serve as weather backups. Covered areas and pavilions provide additional protection. The wedding team monitors weather forecasts continuously and proactively prepares contingency plans. The monsoon season (July-September) is generally not recommended for outdoor ceremonies."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the payment and cancellation policy?",
        "answer": "A 40% advance confirms the booking, with 30% due 90 days prior and the final 30% due 30 days before the event. Cancellations 120+ days before forfeit 30%, 90-119 days forfeit 50%, 60-89 days forfeit 75%, and less than 60 days forfeit 100%. Wedding insurance is highly recommended given the significant investment."

    "longDescription": "Umaid Bhawan Palace stands as one of the world's most extraordinary wedding venues, a magnificent Art Deco palace that remains a residence of the Jodhpur royal family while offering ultra-exclusive destination wedding experiences. Built between 1929 and 1943 for Maharaja Umaid Singh, this architectural marvel spans 26 acres of landscaped gardens and comprises 347 rooms, making it one of the largest private residences in the world. As the preferred venue for India's most high-profile celebrity weddings, Umaid Bhawan Palace represents the absolute pinnacle of luxury destination weddings.\n\nThe palace's architecture is a stunning fusion of Eastern and Western influences, blending Art Deco design with traditional Indian motifs.

Every corner of Umaid Bhawan Palace tells a story of uncompromising luxury and royal heritage that few venues in the world can match.\n\nWhat makes Umaid Bhawan Palace truly exceptional as a wedding venue is its exclusivity and the genuine royal experience it offers.

The Museum Courtyard provides an intimate setting surrounded by vintage cars and royal artifacts, while the Marwar Hall offers a magnificent indoor venue for lavish wedding dinners. The private Royal Suite, with its own swimming pool and panoramic views, serves as the ultimate bridal preparation space.\n\nCulinary experiences at Umaid Bhawan Palace are legendary, with royal kitchens that have preserved recipes from the Jodhpur royal household for generations. The palace's chefs create extraordinary wedding feasts featuring authentic Marwari cuisine, elaborate multi-course royal thalis, and international gourmet options. Private dining can be arranged in various palace settings, from romantic terrace dinners overlooking the Blue City to grand banquets in the Maharaja's private dining room. The wine cellar, one of India's finest, offers carefully curated selections for discerning guests.\n\nThe palace operates as a Taj Hotels property, ensuring world-class hospitality while maintaining authentic royal traditions. The wedding planning team has orchestrated some of India's most celebrated weddings, bringing together traditional Marwari ceremonies with contemporary luxury seamlessly.

    "shortDescription": "The former residence of the Maharaja of Jaipur, Rambagh Palace offers India's most storied royal heritage wedding experience with magnificent Mughal gardens and palatial grandeur.",
    "longDescription": "Rambagh Palace, often called the 'Jewel of Jaipur,' stands as India's most celebrated heritage hotel and an extraordinary wedding venue steeped in royal history. Originally built in 1835 as a garden house for the queen's favorite handmaiden, it was later transformed into a hunting lodge and eventually became the beloved residence of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and his queen, Gayatri Devi. Today, as a Taj Hotels property, Rambagh Palace opens its gates to couples seeking to write their own chapter in its storied history, offering wedding experiences that combine authentic royal heritage with contemporary luxury.\n\nThe palace architecture showcases the finest Rajput and Mughal influences, featuring intricate lattice work, ornate pillars, exquisite marble fountains, and beautifully restored period interiors. The 47 acres of Mughal gardens are meticulously maintained, featuring manicured lawns, fragrant flower beds, ancient trees, and dancing peacocks that create a magical atmosphere. The interior spaces retain their original grandeur, with hand-painted frescoes, crystal chandeliers, and period furniture that transport guests to an era of unparalleled royal elegance.\n\nWhat makes Rambagh Palace exceptional as a wedding venue is its authentic royal provenance combined with the professional execution that Taj Hotels provides. Unlike purpose-built hotels, every space within Rambagh Palace has genuine historical significance. The Marble Corridor, the Oriental Cocktail Room, and the Polo Bar all carry stories of the glamorous royal era when international celebrities and dignitaries were regular guests. Wedding celebrations here become part of this continuing legacy, offering couples a connection to India's most romantic royal history.\n\nThe palace offers diverse wedding venues that cater to celebrations of all scales. The sprawling Mughal gardens can accommodate grand celebrations for up to 500 guests, with the illuminated palace façade creating a spectacular backdrop. The Suvarna Mahal, the palace's fine dining restaurant housed in a former royal banquet hall, offers intimate dining experiences, while the various palace halls and courtyards provide settings for different wedding functions. The property's ability to host entire weddings on-site, with multiple venues for different functions, makes it ideal for elaborate multi-day celebrations.\n\nCulinary experiences at Rambagh Palace draw from the rich heritage of the Jaipur royal kitchens. The Suvarna Mahal offers regal dining in a setting unchanged since maharaja days, complete with live classical music and impeccable service. For weddings, the culinary team creates elaborate feasts featuring authentic Rajasthani royal recipes alongside contemporary Indian and international cuisines. The palace's famous high tea and champagne receptions add sophisticated touches to wedding celebrations that guests remember long after.\n\nAccommodation at Rambagh Palace comprises 78 rooms and suites, each uniquely decorated with period furnishings and modern amenities. The Maharani Suite and Peacock Suite offer palatial accommodations for the wedding couple, complete with private terraces and butler service. The Jiva Spa provides traditional Ayurvedic treatments for pre-wedding relaxation, while the palace's croquet lawns, polo ground, and indoor pool offer leisure activities for wedding guests. For couples dreaming of a wedding in India's most famous palace hotel, Rambagh Palace offers an experience that combines living history with legendary hospitality.",

    "shortDescription": "A stunning 75-acre beachfront resort inspired by ancient Goan and Portuguese architecture, offering spectacular lagoon views and Arabian Sea beach weddings.",
    "longDescription": "The Leela Goa stands as one of India's most distinguished beach wedding destinations, a magnificent 75-acre resort that seamlessly blends ancient Goan heritage with contemporary luxury. Located on the pristine shores of Mobor Beach in South Goa, the resort is built around a natural lagoon and inspired by the architecture of the ancient City of Vijayanagara, creating a unique setting unlike any other beach resort in India. For couples seeking a destination wedding that combines beach romance with cultural richness, The Leela Goa offers an unparalleled experience.\n\nThe resort's architecture draws inspiration from the grand Vijayanagara Empire and Portuguese colonial influences, featuring dramatic laterite structures, temple-inspired gateways, and intricate stone carvings. The property is designed around a 12-acre lagoon that reflects the ornate architecture, creating spectacular visual drama, especially when illuminated for evening celebrations. The landscaping includes lush tropical gardens, ancient trees, and winding pathways that lead to various wedding venues, each offering its own distinct ambiance and character.\n\nWhat distinguishes The Leela Goa as a premier wedding venue is its extraordinary variety of settings within a single property. The beachfront lawns offer traditional beach wedding backdrops with the Arabian Sea stretching to the horizon. The lagoon-facing venues provide romantic water views with the resort's architectural grandeur reflected in the tranquil waters. The riverside area offers intimate settings away from the beach, while the pool deck provides a glamorous resort atmosphere for cocktail parties and sangeet celebrations.\n\nThe resort offers 206 rooms, suites, and villas, many with private gardens, lagoon views, or direct beach access. The Lagoon Suite and Royal Villa provide exceptional accommodations for the wedding couple, with private pools, butler service, and panoramic views. The Club at The Leela offers elevated experiences for discerning guests, while the spa provides comprehensive bridal packages combining Ayurvedic traditions with contemporary treatments. Golf enthusiasts can enjoy the adjacent 12-hole golf course, adding recreational options for wedding guests.\n\nCulinary experiences at The Leela Goa showcase the rich coastal heritage of Goan cuisine alongside sophisticated international options. The resort's restaurants include The Riverside for Goan and Susegad Portuguese-influenced dining, and Jamavar for fine Indian cuisine. For weddings, the culinary team creates memorable feasts featuring fresh seafood, traditional Goan preparations, and elaborate international spreads. Beach barbecues, poolside brunches, and formal lagoon-side dinners can all be arranged, creating diverse dining experiences across the celebration.\n\nThe wedding planning team at The Leela Goa brings decades of experience in executing beach weddings with the sophistication expected of a Leela property. From managing the logistics of outdoor celebrations to creating spectacular décor installations that complement the resort's unique architecture, the team ensures flawless execution. The property's size allows for multiple events to occur simultaneously without overlap, making it ideal for elaborate Indian weddings with numerous functions and guests requiring varied experiences.",

    "shortDescription": "Kerala's premier backwater wedding destination featuring traditional heritage villas, meandering lagoons, and authentic Kerala hospitality on Vembanad Lake.",
    "longDescription": "Kumarakom Lake Resort stands as Kerala's most distinguished wedding destination, a magnificent heritage property spread across 25 acres of lush tropical gardens on the banks of the legendary Vembanad Lake. This extraordinary resort preserves and celebrates Kerala's rich heritage through its unique accommodation of restored ancestral homes (tharavads) relocated and reconstructed on the property, offering couples a wedding experience deeply rooted in the authentic traditions of God's Own Country.\n\nThe resort's architecture is a living museum of Kerala's traditional building arts, featuring original tharavads dating back 100-200 years, complete with intricately carved wooden ceilings, traditional tile roofs, and verandahs that open to serene backwater views. The 59 heritage villas and pool villas are nestled among coconut palms, fruit orchards, and flowering gardens, connected by stone pathways and meandering canals. The effect is of a traditional Kerala village reimagined as a luxury resort, providing wedding guests with an immersive cultural experience.\n\nWhat makes Kumarakom Lake Resort exceptional as a wedding venue is its ability to offer authentic Kerala wedding experiences that few properties can match. The resort's setting on Vembanad Lake allows for spectacular kettu vallam (traditional houseboat) arrivals for the bride and groom, a uniquely Kerala tradition that creates unforgettable memories. The Aymanam House, the resort's main heritage mansion, serves as a stunning venue for traditional Kerala wedding ceremonies, complete with brass oil lamps, temple flowers, and classical music.\n\nThe property offers diverse wedding venues that showcase Kerala's natural beauty. The lakefront lawn provides breathtaking sunset backdrops with the backwaters stretching to the horizon. The meandering lagoon areas offer intimate settings for mehendi and smaller functions, while the pool villas can host exclusive gatherings for close family. The Ettukettu restaurant, housed in an eight-cornered traditional mansion, offers a spectacular indoor venue for wedding dinners surrounded by antique wooden pillars and traditional craftsmanship.\n\nCulinary experiences at Kumarakom Lake Resort showcase Kerala's rich gastronomic heritage. The resort's chefs are masters of traditional Sadhya (Kerala feast) preparation, creating elaborate banana leaf spreads featuring over 26 vegetarian dishes prepared according to ancestral recipes. Fresh seafood from the backwaters, traditional Malabar cuisine, and contemporary Indian options complement the traditional offerings. For weddings, the culinary team can create elaborate multi-cuisine experiences while maintaining the authentic Kerala character that makes celebrations here so special.\n\nThe resort's Ayurveda spa, Ayurmana, offers comprehensive pre-wedding wellness programs based on authentic Kerala traditions. The traditional treatments, performed by trained therapists in serene settings overlooking the backwaters, help couples and their families relax and rejuvenate before celebrations. Village walks, cooking classes, canoe rides through the backwaters, and bird watching expeditions provide memorable activities for wedding guests, creating a complete destination experience beyond the ceremonies themselves.",

    "shortDescription": "Experience the magic of desert weddings at Suryagarh Jaisalmer, a magnificent fort-palace rising from the golden Thar Desert, offering unparalleled Rajasthani hospitality and celestial starlit celebrations.",
    "longDescription": "Suryagarh Jaisalmer stands as a testament to Rajasthan's architectural grandeur, a spectacular sandstone fortress that emerges majestically from the golden dunes of the Thar Desert. This award-winning luxury resort redefines destination weddings in India, offering couples the rare opportunity to celebrate their union beneath a canopy of a million stars, surrounded by the mystical beauty of the world's most romantic desert landscape. For those seeking a wedding venue that transcends the ordinary, Suryagarh delivers an experience that feels lifted from the pages of Arabian Nights.\n\nThe property's architecture pays homage to centuries of Rajasthani craftsmanship, with intricately carved jharokhas (traditional balconies), ornate jaali work, and soaring turrets that catch the golden light of the desert sun. Every corridor reveals new artistic treasures, from hand-painted frescos depicting royal hunting scenes to antique furniture collected from the noble houses of Rajasthan. The attention to detail extends throughout the 83 luxuriously appointed suites and rooms, each offering a unique blend of heritage aesthetics and contemporary comforts.\n\nWedding celebrations at Suryagarh unfold across multiple breathtaking venues, each more spectacular than the last. The Dunes, a 45,000 square foot expanse of manicured lawns set against the backdrop of the Thar Desert, can accommodate grand celebrations for up to 500 guests. The Nosh restaurant terrace offers intimate dining under the stars, while the Akhara courtyard provides a traditional setting for pheras and religious ceremonies. For truly extraordinary experiences, Suryagarh arranges exclusive celebrations in the desert itself, with elaborate tent setups, camel processions, and folk performances that bring the romance of the silk road to life.\n\nThe culinary team at Suryagarh has mastered the art of desert gastronomy, presenting authentic Marwari cuisine alongside contemporary Indian and international dishes. Their signature experiences include dune-top dinners where guests feast on traditional laal maas and ker sangri while watching the sun set over the endless golden sands. The resort's extensive wine cellar and craft cocktail program ensure celebrations sparkle long into the star-filled desert nights.\n\nWhat truly distinguishes Suryagarh is the desert itself. Wedding guests can explore the Thar on camelback, witness spectacular sunsets from private dune points, enjoy folk music performances by local Manganiyar musicians, and experience the profound silence of desert nights punctuated only by crackling bonfires and the distant calls of desert creatures. For couples seeking a wedding that offers adventure alongside elegance, Suryagarh creates memories that last lifetimes.\n\nThe wedding planning team at Suryagarh specializes in crafting bespoke celebrations that honor both tradition and personal style. From elaborate henna ceremonies in lantern-lit courtyards to sangeet nights featuring Rajasthani folk dancers and contemporary DJs, every event is choreographed with precision and passion. The property's remote location ensures complete privacy, while its world-class infrastructure guarantees that every luxury is available even in this magical desert setting.",

    "shortDescription": "Celebrate your union at RAAS Jodhpur, a stunning boutique heritage hotel nestled at the base of the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort, blending 18th-century Rajasthani architecture with contemporary luxury for intimate destination weddings.",
    "longDescription": "RAAS Jodhpur represents the perfect marriage of heritage and contemporary design, a boutique luxury hotel that has redefined intimate destination weddings in the Blue City. Nestled within the ancient walls of Jodhpur's walled city, directly beneath the imposing Mehrangarh Fort, RAAS offers couples a wedding experience that is simultaneously deeply rooted in Rajasthani tradition and refreshingly modern in its execution. This is not merely a hotel; it is a carefully curated collection of 18th-century havelis transformed into an architectural masterpiece.\n\nThe property's design philosophy celebrates the raw beauty of Jodhpur's traditional architecture while introducing clean contemporary lines and luxurious modern amenities. Red sandstone walls, restored wooden doorways, traditional lime plaster, and indigenous stone work create an atmosphere of timeless elegance. The 78 rooms and suites are spread across restored havelis, each offering unique layouts, private sit-outs, and spectacular views of either the fort or the blue-washed houses of the old city.\n\nWedding celebrations at RAAS unfold across intimate yet impressive venues. The Baradari, a stunning open-air pavilion, can seat 150 guests for ceremonies with the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort as a natural backdrop. The Step Garden, with its cascading levels and water features, provides a romantic setting for sangeet and cocktail evenings. The Darikhana, the restored haveli's original living room, offers an intimate space for mehendi ceremonies and smaller gatherings. For truly spectacular experiences, RAAS can arrange exclusive access to terraces with unobstructed fort views, perfect for golden-hour ceremonies as the sun sets behind the ancient citadel.\n\nThe culinary program at RAAS celebrates the diverse flavors of Marwar, presenting traditional Jodhpuri dishes alongside modern interpretations of Indian cuisine. The kitchen team sources ingredients from local farms and specialty producers, creating menus that tell the story of the region's rich culinary heritage. From mirchi vada and mawa kachori at the mehendi to elaborate multi-course wedding feasts featuring safed maas and govind gatta, every meal becomes a celebration of Rajasthani gastronomy.\n\nWhat distinguishes RAAS for intimate weddings is its boutique scale combined with world-class service. Unlike larger properties where weddings can feel like one of many events, RAAS offers personalized attention that makes every celebration feel exclusive. The dedicated wedding team works closely with couples to craft bespoke experiences, from arranging traditional musicians from the Langa and Manganiyar communities to organizing shopping excursions in Jodhpur's famous markets, from coordinating elaborate mehendi artists to managing complex multi-day celebration logistics.\n\nThe location itself becomes part of the wedding experience. Guests staying at RAAS can explore the labyrinthine streets of the Blue City, visit the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort Museum, shop for handicrafts and textiles in the bustling bazaars, and discover the hidden temples and step-wells that dot the old city. For destination wedding guests, RAAS offers an immersive cultural experience that extends far beyond the wedding celebrations themselves.",

    "shortDescription": "Step into a fairytale at Samode Palace, a 475-year-old royal residence nestled in the Aravalli hills, offering authentic Rajputana grandeur with hand-painted murals, mirrored halls, and timeless romantic charm.",
    "longDescription": "Samode Palace is not merely a wedding venue—it is a living museum of Rajputana artistry and royal heritage that has witnessed over four centuries of celebrations, romances, and family traditions. This magnificent 475-year-old palace, still owned and operated by the Samode royal family, offers couples the rare opportunity to celebrate their union in an authentic historic setting that no modern construction can replicate. For those seeking a wedding that feels like stepping into a bygone era of maharajas and royal ceremonies, Samode Palace delivers an experience of unparalleled authenticity.\n\nThe palace's artistic heritage is immediately evident upon entering its gates. Every surface tells a story through elaborate hand-painted murals depicting royal hunts, celestial beings, and geometric patterns executed in the distinctive Samode style that blends Mughal and Rajput artistic traditions. The famed Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace) dazzles visitors with thousands of tiny mirrors embedded in intricate patterns, creating a kaleidoscope of reflected candlelight during evening celebrations. The Durbar Hall, with its original painted walls and royal seating, provides a ceremonial space that requires no decoration—its beauty is complete.\n\nWedding celebrations at Samode Palace unfold across a tapestry of romantic venues, each with its own character and charm. The sprawling palace lawns, surrounded by historic walls and backed by the Aravalli hills, accommodate ceremonies for up to 300 guests. The stepped garden, with its fountains and terraced levels, creates a dramatic setting for sangeet celebrations. The palace courtyards, intimate and enclosed by painted archways, host mehendi ceremonies bathed in natural light. For evening receptions, the Sheesh Mahal and Durbar Hall provide indoor grandeur that photographs beautifully in candlelight.\n\nThe 43 rooms and suites within the palace maintain their historic character while offering modern comforts. Each room features original artwork, antique furniture, and unique architectural details—no two rooms are alike. The royal suites occupy the palace's most significant chambers, offering carved marble bathrooms, private terraces, and views over the gardens and hills. Staying at Samode Palace means living as royalty did, surrounded by history and art at every turn.\n\nCulinary experiences at Samode Palace celebrate the rich traditions of Rajasthani cuisine alongside refined continental options. The palace kitchen has served generations of the royal family and their guests, maintaining recipes passed down through centuries while adapting to contemporary tastes. Wedding feasts can include everything from elaborate Rajasthani thalis served on silver thalis to European-style courses. The palace can arrange intimate dinners in the gardens, group dining in historic halls, or elaborate outdoor feasts under the stars.\n\nWhat makes Samode Palace truly special for weddings is its authenticity. The family's ongoing involvement ensures that celebrations honor both the venue's heritage and the significance of the wedding occasion. Traditional ceremonies are conducted with genuine understanding of their meaning, not merely as performance. The palace's relative seclusion—just 45 kilometers from Jaipur—provides privacy and tranquility impossible to find in city venues, while remaining accessible for guests arriving from near and far.",

The Marvelous Suites and Extreme WOW Suite offer expanded spaces for bridal parties and VIP guests, complete with outdoor bathtubs, private pools, and sweeping sea views that make getting ready as photogenic as the ceremony itself.\n\nCulinary experiences at W Goa match the venue's bold personality. Spice Traders delivers contemporary Asian-Goan fusion, while Rock Pool serves seafood with views. The resort's mixology program elevates celebrations with creative cocktails and molecular bartending. For weddings, the culinary team creates custom menus blending Goan coastal traditions with global influences, presented with theatrical flair that transforms every meal into an event.\n\nWhat truly distinguishes W Goa for weddings is the Whatever/Whenever philosophy—if you can dream it, the W team will make it happen. From arranging surprise performances by celebrated artists to coordinating sunrise after-parties on the beach, from creating custom cocktails that tell your love story to organizing boat arrivals via the Arabian Sea, W Goa delivers experiences that conventional venues cannot imagine. For couples seeking a wedding that celebrates their individuality with unapologetic style, W Goa is the ultimate stage.",

    "longDescription": "ITC Grand Goa stands as South Goa's most magnificent celebration destination, a 45-acre paradise that reimagines the traditional Goan village as a canvas for the grandest wedding celebrations. Part of Marriott's prestigious Luxury Collection, this award-winning resort combines ITC's legendary Indian hospitality with international luxury standards, creating a destination where couples can host celebrations of extraordinary scale without sacrificing intimacy, authenticity, or service excellence.\n\nThe resort's design philosophy draws deeply from Goan architectural heritage, recreating the charm of a traditional waterfront village complete with cobblestone pathways, Portuguese-style balcaos, terracotta roofs, and churches that anchor the property's visual identity. Sixteen interconnected waterways and cascading water bodies create a Venice-like atmosphere, with intimate bridges connecting different zones of the property. The effect is magical—a place where modernity serves tradition rather than replacing it.\n\nWith 252 rooms and suites arranged in villa-style clusters, ITC Grand Goa can accommodate wedding parties of significant scale while maintaining the intimate village atmosphere. The rooms reflect Goan heritage with four-poster beds, traditional furniture, and private balconies overlooking waterways or gardens. The Presidential Suites and Manor Suite offer exceptional luxury for the couple and VIP family members.\n\nWedding venues at ITC Grand Goa achieve scales unmatched by most beach properties. The Grand Lawn, an expansive 75,000 square foot oceanfront venue, can host celebrations for up to 1,500 guests—making it ideal for the grandest Indian wedding celebrations. The indoor Grand Ballroom offers 12,000 square feet of climate-controlled elegance. Multiple waterfront venues, courtyards, and intimate gardens provide options for every event type, from mehendi gatherings to grand receptions.\n\nITC's culinary reputation reaches its zenith at Grand Goa. The resort features multiple specialty restaurants, including the acclaimed Peshawri for Northwest Frontier cuisine, Tempero for Mediterranean fare, and specialty Goan restaurants showcasing coastal traditions. For weddings, the legendary ITC culinary team creates bespoke menus that can feature anything from elaborate Rajasthani thalis to seven-course continental dinners, executed with precision at scales few hotels can manage.\n\nThe Kaya Kalp Royal Spa, one of India's most awarded wellness destinations, provides comprehensive pre-wedding services from traditional Ayurvedic treatments to contemporary beauty services. For wedding guests, the resort offers exceptional recreation including swimming pools, water sports, fitness center, and curated cultural experiences that showcase Goa's unique heritage.",

    "shortDescription": "Experience waterfront elegance at Taj Malabar Cochin, a historic heritage hotel overlooking the Arabian Sea and Cochin harbour, where colonial charm meets tropical luxury for unforgettable destination weddings.",
    "longDescription": "Taj Malabar Resort & Spa occupies one of the most enchanting locations in all of India—the tip of Willingdon Island overlooking where the backwaters meet the Arabian Sea. This storied property, dating to 1935, has witnessed countless celebrations of love, hosting royalty, dignitaries, and discerning couples who recognize that few places on earth offer such a perfect confluence of history, natural beauty, and sophisticated hospitality. For destination weddings that seek to capture the mystical allure of Kerala, Taj Malabar delivers an experience both intimate and unforgettable.\n\nThe resort's architecture tells the story of Cochin's cosmopolitan heritage, blending Dutch, Portuguese, British, and indigenous Kerala influences into a cohesive colonial elegance. The historic Tower Wing, dating to the original 1935 construction, offers suites that have hosted generations of distinguished guests. The contemporary Malabar Wing extends into the harbour with rooms featuring private balconies overlooking the sea. Throughout the property, antique furniture, period photographs, and traditional craft work create an atmosphere of gracious living from another era.\n\nWedding venues at Taj Malabar maximize the spectacular waterfront setting. The Harbour Lawn, stretching along the water's edge, hosts ceremonies and receptions for up to 400 guests with the harbour's Chinese fishing nets and passing ships creating an ever-changing backdrop. The Poolside Terrace offers a more intimate setting for sangeet and cocktail celebrations. For indoor elegance, the ballroom provides climate-controlled comfort with harbour views. The resort can also arrange celebrations on the private pier, with the couple arriving by traditional Kettuvallam houseboat.\n\nCulinary traditions at Taj Malabar celebrate Kerala's extraordinary food heritage. The Pepper & Rice restaurant showcases the coastal state's famous seafood preparations and vegetarian delicacies. The resort's chefs source ingredients from local spice plantations and fishing communities, creating menus that tell the story of the Spice Coast. For weddings, the culinary team crafts bespoke menus blending Kerala Sadhya traditions with continental sophistication, served in the elaborate style befitting the venue's heritage.\n\nThe Jiva Spa provides pre-wedding wellness rooted in Kerala's legendary Ayurvedic traditions. From traditional Abhyanga massages to bride and groom preparation rituals, the spa team draws on centuries of holistic healing knowledge. Wedding guests can also explore Cochin's remarkable cultural treasures, from the ancient synagogue and Portuguese palace in Jew Town to the Chinese fishing nets of Fort Kochi, all within minutes of the resort.\n\nWhat distinguishes Taj Malabar for destination weddings is its ability to immerse guests in Kerala's unique culture while maintaining the gracious service standards for which Taj is renowned worldwide. The wedding planning team crafts celebrations that honor local traditions—from Thali ceremonies to traditional percussion performances—while incorporating the couple's personal vision.",

    "shortDescription": "Perched on a dramatic cliff overlooking the Arabian Sea, The Leela Kovalam offers breathtaking sunset ceremonies, pristine private beaches, and Kerala's legendary hospitality for unforgettable destination weddings.",
    "longDescription": "The Leela Kovalam commands one of India's most spectacular coastal positions—a dramatic cliff-top perch overlooking the iconic Kovalam Beach and the endless expanse of the Arabian Sea. This legendary resort has defined luxury beach tourism in Kerala since its opening, offering couples a destination wedding venue where every sunset feels like a divine blessing and every moment carries the whisper of the waves below. For those seeking beach wedding magic with a touch of theatrical drama, The Leela Kovalam delivers an experience that photographs beautifully and lives forever in memory.\n\nThe resort's architecture harmonizes with its stunning natural setting, with low-rise buildings cascading down the cliff face through tropical gardens. Traditional Kerala architectural elements—sloping tiled roofs, wooden verandahs, and open-air courtyards—blend with contemporary luxury amenities. The property's multiple levels create intimate zones and dramatic viewpoints, with every corner revealing new perspectives of the azure sea below.\n\nWith 183 rooms and suites spread across the cliff-side property, The Leela Kovalam accommodates substantial wedding parties while maintaining the intimate resort atmosphere that defines the property's charm. The Beach Villas offer direct sand access for couples seeking ultimate privacy. The Cliff Suites provide panoramic ocean views from private balconies. Throughout the accommodation, the design celebrates Kerala's craft traditions with contemporary comfort.\n\nWedding venues at The Leela Kovalam leverage the extraordinary setting with creativity. The Beach Lawn, stretching along the private beach below the cliff, hosts ceremonies for up to 500 guests with the sea as witness. The Cliff-Top Lawn offers a more elevated perspective, with sunset ceremonies unfolding as the sun dips into the Arabian Sea. The open-air Tides restaurant terrace becomes a romantic dinner venue. Indoor celebrations are hosted in the elegant ballroom with floor-to-ceiling windows framing ocean views.\n\nThe culinary program celebrates Kerala's extraordinary food traditions with particular emphasis on the state's famous seafood preparations. Fresh catch from local fishermen, spices from nearby plantations, and family recipes passed down through generations combine in menus that tell the story of God's Own Country. The resort's restaurants—The Terrace for all-day dining, Sky Grill for oceanside barbecue, and the specialty outlets—provide diverse dining experiences for multi-day wedding celebrations.\n\nDivya Spa draws on Kerala's millennia-old Ayurvedic healing traditions, offering treatments that prepare the body and mind for life's significant transitions. From traditional Panchakarma purification to modern beauty services, the spa team creates comprehensive pre-wedding wellness programs. Wedding guests can also explore Kerala's cultural treasures, from Padmanabhaswamy Temple in nearby Trivandrum to the historic lighthouse and fishing villages of Kovalam.",

Rising majestically beside the Gateway of India on Mumbai's iconic waterfront, this legendary property represents the pinnacle of Indian hospitality, a place where generations of royalty, world leaders, celebrities, and prominent families have celebrated life's most significant moments. For couples seeking a wedding venue that carries the weight of history and the prestige of an unmatched legacy, The Taj Mahal Palace stands alone.\n\nThe hotel's architecture is immediately recognizable, a stunning fusion of Moorish, Oriental, and Florentine styles that has defined Mumbai's skyline since 1903. The original Palace Wing, with its soaring dome, ornate interiors, and hand-woven carpets, transports guests to an era of unbridled elegance. The Tower Wing adds contemporary luxury while maintaining the property's refined character. Throughout both wings, museum-quality antiques, crystal chandeliers, and original artwork create an atmosphere of living history.\n\nWith 285 rooms and suites across the Palace and Tower wings, The Taj Mahal Palace accommodates wedding parties in surroundings that befit the occasion's significance. The Palace Wing's heritage rooms feature antique furniture, high ceilings, and original architectural details. The Grande Presidential Suite, spanning 4,840 square feet with bay views, offers the ultimate bridal preparation space. Every room tells a story, carrying guests into the grand narrative of India's most celebrated hotel.\n\nWedding venues at The Taj Mahal Palace combine history with capability. The Crystal Room, with its original Belgian crystal chandeliers and ornate ceiling, hosts elegant receptions for up to 300 guests. The Ballroom accommodates larger celebrations while maintaining the property's sophisticated atmosphere. The Sea Lounge terrace offers intimate gatherings with Gateway views. For truly exceptional moments, the hotel can arrange exclusive use of spaces that have hosted coronations and state dinners.\n\nCulinary excellence at The Taj Mahal Palace encompasses legendary restaurants including Wasabi by Morimoto, Masala Kraft, and the historic Harbour Bar. The wedding culinary team draws from this extraordinary expertise, creating menus that honor the property's tradition of gastronomic excellence. From elaborate Indian wedding feasts to sophisticated continental dinners, every meal reflects the attention to detail that has defined Taj hospitality for over a century.\n\nService at The Taj Mahal Palace operates at a level that few properties worldwide can match. The wedding planning team, many of whom have spent entire careers at the property, bring institutional knowledge that anticipates needs before they arise. This is a hotel that has orchestrated celebrations for India's most prominent families—understanding of protocol, discretion, and excellence is embedded in the culture.

    "shortDescription": "Reign over your wedding at Taj Falaknuma Palace, the magnificent former residence of the Nizam of Hyderabad perched 2000 feet above the city, offering authentic Nizami grandeur and unparalleled romantic opulence.",
    "longDescription": "Taj Falaknuma Palace is quite simply India's most romantic palace hotel—a magnificent 19th-century scorpion-shaped palace that once served as the residence of the Nizam of Hyderabad, the world's wealthiest man of his era. Perched 2,000 feet above the city on a plateau with commanding views of Hyderabad's ancient quarters, this extraordinary property offers couples the rare opportunity to celebrate their union in surroundings of genuine royal splendor. Here, every wedding becomes a page from a fairy tale, set against the backdrop of one of India's most opulent private residences.\n\nThe palace's architecture and interiors represent the zenith of 19th-century aristocratic luxury. Venetian chandeliers, some weighing over a ton, illuminate grand halls. The world's largest dining table seats 101 guests beneath hand-painted ceilings. Rare antiques, including chairs that once belonged to Louis XIV and Ming vases, furnish royal chambers. The jade collection rivals museum holdings. Throughout the palace, the extravagance speaks of an era when wealth knew no bounds and craftsmanship reached artistic heights.\n\nWith only 60 rooms and suites, Taj Falaknuma Palace offers exclusivity that larger properties cannot match. Each accommodation occupies original palace quarters, with suites spanning multiple rooms filled with antique furniture and original artwork. The Nizam Suites offer the ultimate in royal accommodation, with private butler service and access to palace treasures. Staying at Falaknuma means living as the Nizam's guests once did, surrounded by authentic opulence at every turn.\n\nWedding venues at Taj Falaknuma Palace leverage the spectacular architecture and grounds. The palace lawns, with the city spread below, host ceremonies for up to 350 guests beneath historic stone walls and ancient trees. The Durbar Hall, with its original chandeliers and royal portraits, provides an indoor setting of incomparable grandeur. The Jade Room and Mirror Room offer intimate spaces for ceremonies and family gatherings. The terraces provide romantic settings for sunset cocktails and twilight celebrations.\n\nCulinary experiences at Falaknuma draw from the legendary kitchens of the Nizams. The palace's restaurants present both authentic Hyderabadi cuisine—including the original Nizam recipes—and refined continental fare. The famous Falaknuma biryani, prepared with centuries-old techniques, anchors wedding feasts. The 101-seat dining table can be reserved for extraordinary dinner experiences. The culinary team creates menus that honor the palace's heritage while accommodating contemporary preferences.\n\nThe approach to Falaknuma itself becomes part of the wedding experience. Guests arrive in vintage horse-drawn carriages, ascending the winding road to the palace gates. The butler service, modeled on the Nizam's household traditions, attends to every need with practiced discretion. For couples seeking a wedding venue where history, romance, and genuine aristocratic splendor converge, Taj Falaknuma Palace remains unequaled anywhere in the world.",

For couples seeking a wedding venue where the very setting speaks of devotion and romance, Amarvilas creates an experience that no other property in the world can match. Here, ceremonies unfold with the Taj Mahal's silhouette marking the horizon, and receptions take place beneath starlit skies with the marble dome glowing in the moonlight.\n\nThe resort's architecture pays homage to Mughal traditions, with terraced lawns, fountains, reflection pools, and pavilions that echo the gardens surrounding the Taj Mahal itself. The interiors blend classical Mughal motifs with contemporary luxury, creating spaces that feel both timeless and comfortable.

The Kohinoor Suite offers the ultimate bridal experience, with its expansive living spaces and unrivaled Taj views. The attention to detail in room design reflects Oberoi's legendary commitment to guest comfort.\n\nWedding venues at Amarvilas leverage the extraordinary Taj Mahal views. The manicured lawns, spread across multiple levels, provide ceremony spaces with the monument as backdrop—a setting that needs no decoration. The pool terrace offers an intimate alternative with reflections of the Taj shimmering in the water. Indoor celebrations unfold in elegant venues with large windows framing the monument. The small scale ensures every wedding receives the property's complete attention.\n\nCulinary excellence at Amarvilas draws from Mughlai traditions appropriate to the setting, alongside refined continental and Asian options. Bellevue restaurant offers all-day dining with Taj views, while Esphahan serves refined Indian cuisine. The wedding culinary team creates menus that honor the Mughal heritage while accommodating diverse palates.

For couples seeking a destination wedding that combines natural grandeur with refined luxury, Wildflower Hall offers an escape from the ordinary into a realm of crisp mountain air, pristine forests, and horizons that stretch to forever.

The interiors celebrate mountain living with warm wood paneling, stone fireplaces, and large windows framing the spectacular views. Throughout the property, the design philosophy respects the environment while creating spaces of understated elegance and natural luxury.\n\nWith only 85 rooms, suites, and residences, Wildflower Hall maintains the intimate atmosphere that defines exceptional mountain resorts. Each accommodation offers views of either the valley below or the snow-capped peaks beyond, with private balconies providing personal observation points for the ever-changing mountain scenery. The Lord Kitchener Suite and Oberoi Suite offer expansive living spaces for the wedding couple, with fireplaces and panoramic windows creating romantic retreats.\n\nWedding venues at Wildflower Hall leverage the extraordinary mountain setting. The terraced lawns, surrounded by ancient cedars and overlooking the valley, provide ceremony spaces with the Himalayas as backdrop. The indoor venues offer warm, elegant settings for winter celebrations when the mountains wear their snow blankets. The poolside terrace, heated for comfort, hosts cocktail gatherings with sunset views over the peaks. The flexibility of venues allows celebrations in any season.\n\nCulinary experiences at Wildflower Hall celebrate mountain bounty and diverse traditions. The restaurant serves refined Indian and continental cuisine with ingredients sourced from local farms and the property's own gardens. For weddings, the culinary team creates menus that can range from elaborate North Indian celebrations to sophisticated multi-cuisine experiences, all prepared with the attention to detail that defines Oberoi hospitality.\n\nThe Oberoi Spa draws from Himalayan wellness traditions, offering treatments that incorporate local herbs and mountain influences. The wedding planning team understands the unique logistics of mountain celebrations, from weather contingencies to transportation coordination. For couples seeking a wedding venue where nature's grandeur becomes part of the celebration, Wildflower Hall provides an experience of profound beauty and romance.",

    "longDescription": "Evolve Back Coorg represents the pinnacle of sustainable luxury hospitality in India, a remarkable resort that seamlessly integrates with its coffee plantation setting while delivering experiences of uncommon refinement. Nestled in the misty hills of Kodagu amid 300 acres of organic coffee and spice estates, this property offers couples seeking intimate, nature-immersed weddings a destination where every moment connects with the earth's rhythms. Here, ceremonies unfold in sacred groves, receptions spill onto plantation grounds, and the fragrance of coffee blossoms perfumes celebrations.\n\nThe resort's architecture draws deeply from Kodava (Coorgi) traditions, featuring the distinctive ainmane (traditional homes) reimagined as luxury accommodations. Water bodies, lily ponds, and careful landscaping create transitions between the built environment and surrounding wilderness. Throughout the property, sustainable practices—from organic farming to rainwater harvesting—demonstrate that luxury and environmental responsibility coexist beautifully.\n\nWith 63 private pool villas, each inspired by traditional Kodava architecture, Evolve Back Coorg offers accommodation that celebrates the region's heritage. Every villa features a private pool, outdoor living spaces, and interiors crafted from sustainable materials. The Lily Pool Villas offer romantic settings for couples, while larger families spread across connecting villas. The sense of seclusion within the community creates ideal destination wedding atmospheres.\n\nWedding venues at Evolve Back leverage the extraordinary natural setting. The Ceremonial Ground, a sacred grove amid ancient trees, provides a spiritually resonant space for ceremonies. The Pavilion overlooks lily ponds for reception dinners. The coffee estate itself becomes a venue, with celebrations among the plantation rows. Indoor spaces provide weather backup while maintaining the organic atmosphere. The intimate scale means weddings never exceed 150 guests, ensuring personalization and exclusivity.\n\nCulinary experiences celebrate the abundance of the estate, with restaurants featuring produce from organic gardens, spices from the plantation, and traditional Coorgi cuisine prepared with authentic recipes. The wedding culinary team creates menus that honor local traditions—including the famous Coorgi pork and rice wine—while accommodating diverse preferences. Farm-to-table dining here isn't a concept; it's the natural way of things.\n\nThe spa draws from local wellness traditions, incorporating estate-grown spices and herbs into treatments. Wedding guests can explore the estate through plantation walks, birdwatching, cooking classes, and visits to local villages. For couples seeking weddings that celebrate nature, heritage, and sustainability without compromising luxury, Evolve Back Coorg offers an experience that nourishes body and soul.",
