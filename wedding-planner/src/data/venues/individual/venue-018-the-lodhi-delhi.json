  "longDescription": "The Lodhi represents the absolute pinnacle of luxury hospitality in India's capital—an ultra-exclusive address where the concept of personalized service reaches unprecedented levels. As Delhi's only hotel where every accommodation is a suite, each featuring a private pool or garden, The Lodhi offers couples who accept nothing less than exceptional an opportunity to host celebrations that redefine wedding luxury. This is not a venue for crowds or conventional celebrations; this is for those who seek intimacy elevated to an art form.\n\nThe property's aesthetic draws from India's rich artistic heritage, reimagined through a contemporary lens. Curated art collections featuring works by celebrated Indian artists adorn public spaces and suites alike. The architecture favors clean lines, natural materials, and thoughtful integration of indoor and outdoor living. Gardens spread across the property create serene pockets of greenery unusual in urban Delhi, while the signature private plunge pools offer guests unprecedented privacy and luxury.\n\nWith only 40 suites, The Lodhi provides an exclusivity that larger properties simply cannot match. Each suite spans a minimum of 1,076 square feet, with the Premier and Lodhi Suites offering even more expansive living spaces. Private gardens, plunge pools, and dedicated butler service ensure that the wedding couple and their closest family members experience accommodation that rivals private residences.\n\nWedding venues at The Lodhi prioritize quality over quantity. The manicured lawns provide an intimate outdoor setting for up to 350 guests, framed by mature trees and exquisite landscaping. The sophisticated indoor venues offer climate-controlled elegance for receptions and sangeet celebrations. Private dining rooms host intimate family gatherings, while the pool terrace can be configured for cocktail evenings. The exclusivity means that when you book The Lodhi for a wedding, the celebration commands the property's full attention.\n\nCulinary experiences at The Lodhi reflect the property's commitment to excellence without compromise. Elan, the award-winning restaurant, and Indian Accent, consistently ranked among Asia's best, represent the depth of culinary talent at the couple's disposal. Wedding menus can draw from this expertise, creating bespoke dining experiences that match the occasion's significance. The culinary team specializes in intimate, plated dinners as well as elegant buffet presentations.\n\nThe service philosophy at The Lodhi centers on anticipation and personalization. The wedding team works closely with couples over extended planning periods, understanding preferences, family dynamics, and vision in detail rarely possible at larger venues. Every staff member knows wedding guests by name. Every request receives individual attention. For couples who value service perfection over grand scale, The Lodhi delivers an experience without parallel.",
