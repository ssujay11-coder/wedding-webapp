  "shortDescription": "Celebrate your union at RAAS Jodhpur, a stunning boutique heritage hotel nestled at the base of the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort, blending 18th-century Rajasthani architecture with contemporary luxury for intimate destination weddings.",
  "longDescription": "RAAS Jodhpur represents the perfect marriage of heritage and contemporary design, a boutique luxury hotel that has redefined intimate destination weddings in the Blue City. Nestled within the ancient walls of Jodhpur's walled city, directly beneath the imposing Mehrangarh Fort, RAAS offers couples a wedding experience that is simultaneously deeply rooted in Rajasthani tradition and refreshingly modern in its execution. This is not merely a hotel; it is a carefully curated collection of 18th-century havelis transformed into an architectural masterpiece.\n\nThe property's design philosophy celebrates the raw beauty of Jodhpur's traditional architecture while introducing clean contemporary lines and luxurious modern amenities. Red sandstone walls, restored wooden doorways, traditional lime plaster, and indigenous stone work create an atmosphere of timeless elegance. The 78 rooms and suites are spread across restored havelis, each offering unique layouts, private sit-outs, and spectacular views of either the fort or the blue-washed houses of the old city.\n\nWedding celebrations at RAAS unfold across intimate yet impressive venues. The Baradari, a stunning open-air pavilion, can seat 150 guests for ceremonies with the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort as a natural backdrop. The Step Garden, with its cascading levels and water features, provides a romantic setting for sangeet and cocktail evenings. The Darikhana, the restored haveli's original living room, offers an intimate space for mehendi ceremonies and smaller gatherings. For truly spectacular experiences, RAAS can arrange exclusive access to terraces with unobstructed fort views, perfect for golden-hour ceremonies as the sun sets behind the ancient citadel.\n\nThe culinary program at RAAS celebrates the diverse flavors of Marwar, presenting traditional Jodhpuri dishes alongside modern interpretations of Indian cuisine. The kitchen team sources ingredients from local farms and specialty producers, creating menus that tell the story of the region's rich culinary heritage. From mirchi vada and mawa kachori at the mehendi to elaborate multi-course wedding feasts featuring safed maas and govind gatta, every meal becomes a celebration of Rajasthani gastronomy.\n\nWhat distinguishes RAAS for intimate weddings is its boutique scale combined with world-class service. Unlike larger properties where weddings can feel like one of many events, RAAS offers personalized attention that makes every celebration feel exclusive. The dedicated wedding team works closely with couples to craft bespoke experiences, from arranging traditional musicians from the Langa and Manganiyar communities to organizing shopping excursions in Jodhpur's famous markets, from coordinating elaborate mehendi artists to managing complex multi-day celebration logistics.\n\nThe location itself becomes part of the wedding experience. Guests staying at RAAS can explore the labyrinthine streets of the Blue City, visit the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort Museum, shop for handicrafts and textiles in the bustling bazaars, and discover the hidden temples and step-wells that dot the old city. For destination wedding guests, RAAS offers an immersive cultural experience that extends far beyond the wedding celebrations themselves.",
