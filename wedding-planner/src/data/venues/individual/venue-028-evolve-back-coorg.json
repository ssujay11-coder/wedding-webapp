  "shortDescription": "Immerse in nature at Evolve Back Coorg, an exquisite eco-luxury plantation resort amid coffee estates and rainforest, offering intimate destination weddings with authentic Kodava heritage and sustainable luxury.",
  "longDescription": "Evolve Back Coorg represents the pinnacle of sustainable luxury hospitality in India, a remarkable resort that seamlessly integrates with its coffee plantation setting while delivering experiences of uncommon refinement. Nestled in the misty hills of Kodagu amid 300 acres of organic coffee and spice estates, this property offers couples seeking intimate, nature-immersed weddings a destination where every moment connects with the earth's rhythms. Here, ceremonies unfold in sacred groves, receptions spill onto plantation grounds, and the fragrance of coffee blossoms perfumes celebrations.\n\nThe resort's architecture draws deeply from Kodava (Coorgi) traditions, featuring the distinctive ainmane (traditional homes) reimagined as luxury accommodations. Water bodies, lily ponds, and careful landscaping create transitions between the built environment and surrounding wilderness. Throughout the property, sustainable practices—from organic farming to rainwater harvesting—demonstrate that luxury and environmental responsibility coexist beautifully.\n\nWith 63 private pool villas, each inspired by traditional Kodava architecture, Evolve Back Coorg offers accommodation that celebrates the region's heritage. Every villa features a private pool, outdoor living spaces, and interiors crafted from sustainable materials. The Lily Pool Villas offer romantic settings for couples, while larger families spread across connecting villas. The sense of seclusion within the community creates ideal destination wedding atmospheres.\n\nWedding venues at Evolve Back leverage the extraordinary natural setting. The Ceremonial Ground, a sacred grove amid ancient trees, provides a spiritually resonant space for ceremonies. The Pavilion overlooks lily ponds for reception dinners. The coffee estate itself becomes a venue, with celebrations among the plantation rows. Indoor spaces provide weather backup while maintaining the organic atmosphere. The intimate scale means weddings never exceed 150 guests, ensuring personalization and exclusivity.\n\nCulinary experiences celebrate the abundance of the estate, with restaurants featuring produce from organic gardens, spices from the plantation, and traditional Coorgi cuisine prepared with authentic recipes. The wedding culinary team creates menus that honor local traditions—including the famous Coorgi pork and rice wine—while accommodating diverse preferences. Farm-to-table dining here isn't a concept; it's the natural way of things.\n\nThe spa draws from local wellness traditions, incorporating estate-grown spices and herbs into treatments. Wedding guests can explore the estate through plantation walks, birdwatching, cooking classes, and visits to local villages. For couples seeking weddings that celebrate nature, heritage, and sustainability without compromising luxury, Evolve Back Coorg offers an experience that nourishes body and soul.",
