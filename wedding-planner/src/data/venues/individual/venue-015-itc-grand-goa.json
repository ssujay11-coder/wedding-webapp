  "shortDescription": "Celebrate magnificence at ITC Grand Goa, a spectacular 45-acre Goan village resort on pristine Arossim Beach, offering grandest wedding venues, legendary ITC hospitality, and exquisite culinary excellence.",
  "longDescription": "ITC Grand Goa stands as South Goa's most magnificent celebration destination, a 45-acre paradise that reimagines the traditional Goan village as a canvas for the grandest wedding celebrations. Part of Marriott's prestigious Luxury Collection, this award-winning resort combines ITC's legendary Indian hospitality with international luxury standards, creating a destination where couples can host celebrations of extraordinary scale without sacrificing intimacy, authenticity, or service excellence.\n\nThe resort's design philosophy draws deeply from Goan architectural heritage, recreating the charm of a traditional waterfront village complete with cobblestone pathways, Portuguese-style balcaos, terracotta roofs, and churches that anchor the property's visual identity. Sixteen interconnected waterways and cascading water bodies create a Venice-like atmosphere, with intimate bridges connecting different zones of the property. The effect is magical—a place where modernity serves tradition rather than replacing it.\n\nWith 252 rooms and suites arranged in villa-style clusters, ITC Grand Goa can accommodate wedding parties of significant scale while maintaining the intimate village atmosphere. The rooms reflect Goan heritage with four-poster beds, traditional furniture, and private balconies overlooking waterways or gardens. The Presidential Suites and Manor Suite offer exceptional luxury for the couple and VIP family members.\n\nWedding venues at ITC Grand Goa achieve scales unmatched by most beach properties. The Grand Lawn, an expansive 75,000 square foot oceanfront venue, can host celebrations for up to 1,500 guests—making it ideal for the grandest Indian wedding celebrations. The indoor Grand Ballroom offers 12,000 square feet of climate-controlled elegance. Multiple waterfront venues, courtyards, and intimate gardens provide options for every event type, from mehendi gatherings to grand receptions.\n\nITC's culinary reputation reaches its zenith at Grand Goa. The resort features multiple specialty restaurants, including the acclaimed Peshawri for Northwest Frontier cuisine, Tempero for Mediterranean fare, and specialty Goan restaurants showcasing coastal traditions. For weddings, the legendary ITC culinary team creates bespoke menus that can feature anything from elaborate Rajasthani thalis to seven-course continental dinners, executed with precision at scales few hotels can manage.\n\nThe Kaya Kalp Royal Spa, one of India's most awarded wellness destinations, provides comprehensive pre-wedding services from traditional Ayurvedic treatments to contemporary beauty services. For wedding guests, the resort offers exceptional recreation including swimming pools, water sports, fitness center, and curated cultural experiences that showcase Goa's unique heritage.",
