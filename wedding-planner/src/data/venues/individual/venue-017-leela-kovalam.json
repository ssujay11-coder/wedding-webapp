  "shortDescription": "Perched on a dramatic cliff overlooking the Arabian Sea, The Leela Kovalam offers breathtaking sunset ceremonies, pristine private beaches, and Kerala's legendary hospitality for unforgettable destination weddings.",
  "longDescription": "The Leela Kovalam commands one of India's most spectacular coastal positions—a dramatic cliff-top perch overlooking the iconic Kovalam Beach and the endless expanse of the Arabian Sea. This legendary resort has defined luxury beach tourism in Kerala since its opening, offering couples a destination wedding venue where every sunset feels like a divine blessing and every moment carries the whisper of the waves below. For those seeking beach wedding magic with a touch of theatrical drama, The Leela Kovalam delivers an experience that photographs beautifully and lives forever in memory.\n\nThe resort's architecture harmonizes with its stunning natural setting, with low-rise buildings cascading down the cliff face through tropical gardens. Traditional Kerala architectural elements—sloping tiled roofs, wooden verandahs, and open-air courtyards—blend with contemporary luxury amenities. The property's multiple levels create intimate zones and dramatic viewpoints, with every corner revealing new perspectives of the azure sea below.\n\nWith 183 rooms and suites spread across the cliff-side property, The Leela Kovalam accommodates substantial wedding parties while maintaining the intimate resort atmosphere that defines the property's charm. The Beach Villas offer direct sand access for couples seeking ultimate privacy. The Cliff Suites provide panoramic ocean views from private balconies. Throughout the accommodation, the design celebrates Kerala's craft traditions with contemporary comfort.\n\nWedding venues at The Leela Kovalam leverage the extraordinary setting with creativity. The Beach Lawn, stretching along the private beach below the cliff, hosts ceremonies for up to 500 guests with the sea as witness. The Cliff-Top Lawn offers a more elevated perspective, with sunset ceremonies unfolding as the sun dips into the Arabian Sea. The open-air Tides restaurant terrace becomes a romantic dinner venue. Indoor celebrations are hosted in the elegant ballroom with floor-to-ceiling windows framing ocean views.\n\nThe culinary program celebrates Kerala's extraordinary food traditions with particular emphasis on the state's famous seafood preparations. Fresh catch from local fishermen, spices from nearby plantations, and family recipes passed down through generations combine in menus that tell the story of God's Own Country. The resort's restaurants—The Terrace for all-day dining, Sky Grill for oceanside barbecue, and the specialty outlets—provide diverse dining experiences for multi-day wedding celebrations.\n\nDivya Spa draws on Kerala's millennia-old Ayurvedic healing traditions, offering treatments that prepare the body and mind for life's significant transitions. From traditional Panchakarma purification to modern beauty services, the spa team creates comprehensive pre-wedding wellness programs. Wedding guests can also explore Kerala's cultural treasures, from Padmanabhaswamy Temple in nearby Trivandrum to the historic lighthouse and fishing villages of Kovalam.",
