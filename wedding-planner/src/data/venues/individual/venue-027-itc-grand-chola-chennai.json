With India's largest pillarless ballroom and capacity for up to 3,000 guests, ITC Grand Chola has become the venue of choice for South India's most ambitious wedding celebrations.\n\nThe hotel's architecture draws inspiration from the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, one of the Chola dynasty's greatest architectural achievements. Soaring courtyards, intricate stone carvings, bronze sculptures, and design elements that echo millennium-old traditions create an atmosphere of timeless grandeur. Yet the property's infrastructure is thoroughly contemporary, with sophisticated technology and systems supporting events of extraordinary scale.\n\nWith 600 rooms and suites, ITC Grand Chola accommodates wedding parties that would challenge most properties. The accommodation spans from elegant deluxe rooms to the magnificent ITC One floor experiences offering personalized butler service. The Presidential Suite provides the ultimate bridal preparation space with its expansive layout and refined luxury. The sheer scale allows entire wedding parties—plus extended families—to stay on-site.\n\nWedding venues at ITC Grand Chola achieve scales unprecedented in Indian hospitality. The Rajendra Chola Hall, India's largest pillarless ballroom at 21,000 square feet, can accommodate receptions for 3,000 guests. The Convention Centre adds flexible configurations for varied event scales. The outdoor Chola Court provides elegant garden settings. Multiple smaller venues host intimate gatherings, sangeet celebrations, and family dinners. The venue versatility supports complete multi-day weddings of any scale.\n\nCulinary excellence at ITC Grand Chola draws from legendary ITC expertise, with restaurants including Peshawri, Madras Pavilion, and Pan Asian specializing in distinct traditions. The wedding culinary team operates at a level few properties can approach, executing elaborate menus for thousands of guests without compromising quality. From traditional Tamil wedding feasts served on banana leaves to sophisticated multi-cuisine experiences, the capability is extraordinary.\n\nKaya Kalp Spa provides comprehensive wellness services, while the wedding planning team brings institutional experience managing South India's largest celebrations.
