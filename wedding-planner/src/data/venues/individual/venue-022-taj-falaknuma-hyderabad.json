  "shortDescription": "Reign over your wedding at Taj Falaknuma Palace, the magnificent former residence of the Nizam of Hyderabad perched 2000 feet above the city, offering authentic Nizami grandeur and unparalleled romantic opulence.",
  "longDescription": "Taj Falaknuma Palace is quite simply India's most romantic palace hotel—a magnificent 19th-century scorpion-shaped palace that once served as the residence of the Nizam of Hyderabad, the world's wealthiest man of his era. Perched 2,000 feet above the city on a plateau with commanding views of Hyderabad's ancient quarters, this extraordinary property offers couples the rare opportunity to celebrate their union in surroundings of genuine royal splendor. Here, every wedding becomes a page from a fairy tale, set against the backdrop of one of India's most opulent private residences.\n\nThe palace's architecture and interiors represent the zenith of 19th-century aristocratic luxury. Venetian chandeliers, some weighing over a ton, illuminate grand halls. The world's largest dining table seats 101 guests beneath hand-painted ceilings. Rare antiques, including chairs that once belonged to Louis XIV and Ming vases, furnish royal chambers. The jade collection rivals museum holdings. Throughout the palace, the extravagance speaks of an era when wealth knew no bounds and craftsmanship reached artistic heights.\n\nWith only 60 rooms and suites, Taj Falaknuma Palace offers exclusivity that larger properties cannot match. Each accommodation occupies original palace quarters, with suites spanning multiple rooms filled with antique furniture and original artwork. The Nizam Suites offer the ultimate in royal accommodation, with private butler service and access to palace treasures. Staying at Falaknuma means living as the Nizam's guests once did, surrounded by authentic opulence at every turn.\n\nWedding venues at Taj Falaknuma Palace leverage the spectacular architecture and grounds. The palace lawns, with the city spread below, host ceremonies for up to 350 guests beneath historic stone walls and ancient trees. The Durbar Hall, with its original chandeliers and royal portraits, provides an indoor setting of incomparable grandeur. The Jade Room and Mirror Room offer intimate spaces for ceremonies and family gatherings. The terraces provide romantic settings for sunset cocktails and twilight celebrations.\n\nCulinary experiences at Falaknuma draw from the legendary kitchens of the Nizams. The palace's restaurants present both authentic Hyderabadi cuisine—including the original Nizam recipes—and refined continental fare. The famous Falaknuma biryani, prepared with centuries-old techniques, anchors wedding feasts. The 101-seat dining table can be reserved for extraordinary dinner experiences. The culinary team creates menus that honor the palace's heritage while accommodating contemporary preferences.\n\nThe approach to Falaknuma itself becomes part of the wedding experience. Guests arrive in vintage horse-drawn carriages, ascending the winding road to the palace gates. The butler service, modeled on the Nizam's household traditions, attends to every need with practiced discretion. For couples seeking a wedding venue where history, romance, and genuine aristocratic splendor converge, Taj Falaknuma Palace remains unequaled anywhere in the world.",
