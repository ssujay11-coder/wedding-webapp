  "shortDescription": "Experience waterfront elegance at Taj Malabar Cochin, a historic heritage hotel overlooking the Arabian Sea and Cochin harbour, where colonial charm meets tropical luxury for unforgettable destination weddings.",
  "longDescription": "Taj Malabar Resort & Spa occupies one of the most enchanting locations in all of India—the tip of Willingdon Island overlooking where the backwaters meet the Arabian Sea. This storied property, dating to 1935, has witnessed countless celebrations of love, hosting royalty, dignitaries, and discerning couples who recognize that few places on earth offer such a perfect confluence of history, natural beauty, and sophisticated hospitality. For destination weddings that seek to capture the mystical allure of Kerala, Taj Malabar delivers an experience both intimate and unforgettable.\n\nThe resort's architecture tells the story of Cochin's cosmopolitan heritage, blending Dutch, Portuguese, British, and indigenous Kerala influences into a cohesive colonial elegance. The historic Tower Wing, dating to the original 1935 construction, offers suites that have hosted generations of distinguished guests. The contemporary Malabar Wing extends into the harbour with rooms featuring private balconies overlooking the sea. Throughout the property, antique furniture, period photographs, and traditional craft work create an atmosphere of gracious living from another era.\n\nWedding venues at Taj Malabar maximize the spectacular waterfront setting. The Harbour Lawn, stretching along the water's edge, hosts ceremonies and receptions for up to 400 guests with the harbour's Chinese fishing nets and passing ships creating an ever-changing backdrop. The Poolside Terrace offers a more intimate setting for sangeet and cocktail celebrations. For indoor elegance, the ballroom provides climate-controlled comfort with harbour views. The resort can also arrange celebrations on the private pier, with the couple arriving by traditional Kettuvallam houseboat.\n\nCulinary traditions at Taj Malabar celebrate Kerala's extraordinary food heritage. The Pepper & Rice restaurant showcases the coastal state's famous seafood preparations and vegetarian delicacies. The resort's chefs source ingredients from local spice plantations and fishing communities, creating menus that tell the story of the Spice Coast. For weddings, the culinary team crafts bespoke menus blending Kerala Sadhya traditions with continental sophistication, served in the elaborate style befitting the venue's heritage.\n\nThe Jiva Spa provides pre-wedding wellness rooted in Kerala's legendary Ayurvedic traditions. From traditional Abhyanga massages to bride and groom preparation rituals, the spa team draws on centuries of holistic healing knowledge. Wedding guests can also explore Cochin's remarkable cultural treasures, from the ancient synagogue and Portuguese palace in Jew Town to the Chinese fishing nets of Fort Kochi, all within minutes of the resort.\n\nWhat distinguishes Taj Malabar for destination weddings is its ability to immerse guests in Kerala's unique culture while maintaining the gracious service standards for which Taj is renowned worldwide. The wedding planning team crafts celebrations that honor local traditions—from Thali ceremonies to traditional percussion performances—while incorporating the couple's personal vision.",
