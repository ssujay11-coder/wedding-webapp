    {
      "question": "How much does a pre-wedding photoshoot cost in India?",
      "answer": "Pre-wedding shoot costs range from ₹50,000-1 Lakh for basic local shoots, ₹1-3 Lakhs for domestic destination shoots (Goa, Rajasthan, Kerala), and ₹5-15 Lakhs for international destinations. This typically includes photographer fees, travel, permits, and basic styling."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best time for a pre-wedding shoot?",
      "answer": "The golden hours—shortly after sunrise and 1-2 hours before sunset—offer the most flattering light. Overcast days are actually ideal for even lighting without harsh shadows. Avoid midday shoots when possible due to unflattering overhead light."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many outfits should I bring for a pre-wedding shoot?",
      "answer": "Typically 2-3 outfit changes work well: one traditional, one semi-formal, and one casual. This provides variety while leaving enough time for quality shots in each look. More outfits mean less time per setup."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best pre-wedding shoot locations in India?",
      "answer": "Top locations include Jaipur and Udaipur (royal heritage), Goa (beach vibes), Kerala (backwaters and nature), Ladakh (dramatic landscapes), and Rishikesh (spiritual, riverside). Each offers unique aesthetics at different price points."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I book the same photographer for pre-wedding and wedding?",
      "answer": "Booking the same photographer is recommended. The pre-wedding shoot helps build rapport, allows the photographer to understand your best angles, and ensures consistent style across all your wedding content. Many photographers offer combo packages with savings."
