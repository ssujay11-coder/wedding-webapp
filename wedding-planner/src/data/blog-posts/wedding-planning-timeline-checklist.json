      "answer": "Typically 12-18 months for a full destination or elaborate wedding, 9-12 months for mid-size celebrations, and 6-9 months for intimate weddings. Peak season weddings require longer lead times as top vendors book 12-18 months in advance."

      "question": "What should I do first when planning a wedding?",
      "answer": "Start with the big three: set your budget, create a preliminary guest list, and hire a wedding planner (if using one). These decisions inform everything else. Then focus on venue and date selection, as they determine availability for all other vendors."

    {
      "question": "When should I send wedding invitations?",
      "answer": "Send save-the-dates 6-8 months before for destination weddings, 4-6 months for local celebrations. Formal invitations should go out 8-10 weeks before the wedding, with RSVP deadlines 3-4 weeks before to allow for final headcount adjustments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far in advance should I book my wedding venue?",
