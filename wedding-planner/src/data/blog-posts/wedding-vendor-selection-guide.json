Pay final invoices promptly\n2. Write genuine reviews and testimonials\n3. Share tagged photos on social media\n4. Provide referrals when appropriate\n5. Send thank-you notes to standout vendors\n\n## Common Vendor Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Mistake 1: Booking Based on Price Alone\n\nThe cheapest option often costs more in stress, poor quality, or having to fix problems. Value over price should guide decisions.\n\n### Mistake 2: Not Reading Contracts Carefully\n\nEvery word matters. Understand cancellation terms, what's included, and what costs extra before signing.\n\n### Mistake 3: Over-Committing to Vendors\n\nDouble-booking or giving verbal confirmations without deposits can damage your reputation and leave you without options.\n\n### Mistake 4: Micromanaging Professionals\n\nYou hired experts for a reason. Share your vision, then trust them to execute. Constant interference rarely improves outcomes.\n\n### Mistake 5: Ignoring Chemistry\n\nSkills matter, but so does personality fit. You'll work closely with these people during stressful times. Comfort matters.\n\n### Mistake 6: Waiting Too Long to Book\n\nTop vendors book 12-18 months ahead for peak season. Procrastination limits options and may mean settling for second choices.\n\n## The Role of a Wedding Planner in Vendor Management\n\n### What Planners Provide\n\n- **Curated Vendor Lists**: Pre-vetted professionals matching your style and budget\n- **Negotiation Power**: Industry relationships for better terms\n- **Contract Review**: Catching problematic clauses\n- **Coordination**: Managing all vendor communications\n- **Problem-Solving**: Handling issues before they affect you\n- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring deliverables meet standards\n\n### DIY vs. Planner-Managed\n\n| Aspect | DIY | With Planner |\n|--------|-----|-------------|\n| Research time | 100+ hours | 10-20 hours |\n| Vendor meetings | 30-40 | 10-15 (planner filters) |\n| Coordination emails | Hundreds | Minimal |\n| Stress level | High | Managed |\n| Negotiation leverage | Limited | Strong |\n| Day-of management | On you/family | Professional |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBuilding your wedding vendor team is one of the most important aspects of wedding planning. Take time to research, meet multiple options, and trust your instincts about personality fit. Clear communication, detailed contracts, and mutual respect create the foundation for a smooth planning process and a spectacular celebration.\n\nRemember: Your vendors want your wedding to be amazing too—it's their reputation on display. Choose partners who share your vision and watch the magic unfold.\n\n---\n\n**Need help building your dream wedding team?** Elite Wedding Planner's network includes 500+ vetted vendors across India's top destinations.

    {
      "question": "How far in advance should I book my wedding vendors?",
      "answer": "For peak wedding season (October-February), book priority vendors 12-18 months ahead. Venue, planner, and photographer should be first (12-15 months), followed by caterer and decorator (8-12 months), then entertainment and MUA (6-10 months). Off-season weddings allow more flexibility, but top vendors book quickly year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much deposit should I pay wedding vendors?",
      "answer": "Standard deposits range from 25-50% of the total fee. Venues typically require 50% to hold dates, while service providers like photographers and decorators usually ask for 25-30%. Always get receipts and ensure payment terms are clearly outlined in your contract."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I look for in a wedding photographer's portfolio?",
      "answer": "Look for consistency across multiple weddings (not just highlight reels), work in similar lighting conditions to your venues, a mix of posed and candid shots, full wedding stories rather than just key moments, and an editing style that matches your aesthetic preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I negotiate with wedding vendors without being offensive?",
      "answer": "Be upfront about your budget, ask 'what can you add?' rather than demanding discounts, bundle services when possible, book early for leverage, and mention you're comparing quotes professionally. Focus on value rather than just price reduction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I hire a wedding planner or manage vendors myself?",
      "answer": "Consider a planner if you have a complex multi-day celebration, destination wedding, limited time, or high stress tolerance. DIY is feasible for simpler weddings with flexible schedules. Planners save 100+ hours of research, provide negotiation power, and handle day-of coordination that family can't manage while participating in celebrations."
