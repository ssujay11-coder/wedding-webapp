In that moment, you understand why poets have written odes to this city for centuries.\n\n**Udaipur isn't just a wedding destination. It is romance incarnate, a place where every sunset feels like it was composed specifically for lovers.**\n\n![Taj Lake Palace floating on Lake Pichola at sunset](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1585128792020-803d29415281?w=1200&q=80)\n\nThe City of Lakes has earned its place as India's most coveted wedding destination, hosting celebrities, industrialists, and discerning couples who understand that some experiences cannot be replicated anywhere else on Earth.\n\n---\n\n## Why Udaipur Reigns Supreme\n\n### The Udaipur Wedding Experience at a Glance\n\n| Factor | Details |\n|--------|----------|\n| **Budget Range** | ₹40 lakhs to ₹5+ crores |\n| **Peak Season** | October to March |\n| **Guest Capacity** | 50-500 (venue dependent) |\n| **Booking Lead Time** | 12-18 months for palace venues |\n| **Market Position** | India's #1 ultra-luxury destination |\n\n![City Palace Udaipur with Lake Pichola](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1623874106686-5be2b325c8f1?w=1200&q=80)\n\n### What Makes Udaipur Incomparable\n\n**The Lake Palace Effect**\n\nNo other city offers what Udaipur does: actual palaces floating on serene lakes, accessible only by boat.

      "question": "What is the cost of a destination wedding in Udaipur?",
      "answer": "Udaipur destination weddings range from ₹40 lakhs to ₹5+ crores. Heritage hotels start at ₹40-80 lakhs for 150 guests. Premium lakeside properties cost ₹1-2 crores. Ultra-luxury venues like Taj Lake Palace (₹2.8 Cr) and Oberoi Udaivilas (₹3.54 Cr) require booking all rooms and include world-class service."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is better for weddings: Taj Lake Palace or Oberoi Udaivilas?",
      "answer": "Both are exceptional. Taj Lake Palace (83 rooms, max 160 guests) offers incomparable romance as a floating island palace with boat-only access. Oberoi Udaivilas (89 rooms, max 250 guests) offers more contemporary amenities, easier accessibility, and slightly larger capacity. Taj Lake Palace costs approximately ₹2.8 Cr while Udaivilas is ₹3.54 Cr + GST."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Udaipur palace hotels require booking all rooms?",
      "answer": "Full-property buyouts ensure complete privacy and exclusivity for your celebration. This policy means no other guests will be present during your wedding, creating an intimate atmosphere where the entire palace is yours. Most couples cover 50-75% of guest room costs as part of their hospitality."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time for a wedding in Udaipur?",
      "answer": "The best months are November through February when temperatures are pleasant (8-30°C). December and January offer ideal conditions but highest demand.

    },
    {
      "question": "How far in advance should I book an Udaipur wedding venue?",
