    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of a destination wedding in Agra?",

    },
    {

      "answer": "The Oberoi Amarvilas is definitively the best venue—it's the only luxury hotel where every room has unobstructed Taj Mahal views. Located just 600 meters from the monument, its terraces and lawns provide ceremony spaces with the Taj as backdrop. Wedding costs range ₹50-90 lakhs."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the best time for a wedding in Agra?",
      "answer": "October-November and February-March offer the best conditions with clear skies and pleasant temperatures (15-33°C). December-January can have morning fog that obscures Taj views—atmospheric but unpredictable. Avoid April-September due to extreme heat (40°C+) or monsoon rains."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I arrange pre-wedding photography at the Taj Mahal?",
      "answer": "Sunrise photography sessions (entry at 6 AM) offer the best lighting with fewer tourists. Commercial photography requires permits from the Archaeological Survey of India. Drone photography is prohibited. Work with experienced Agra photographers who know the permit process and best angles. Note: the Taj is closed on Fridays."
