      "answer": "Based on 2025 industry data, the average destination wedding costs ₹58 lakhs (up from ₹51.1 lakhs in 2024). Specific venue costs: Taj Lake Palace Udaipur starts at ₹2.8 Cr for 160 guests, Oberoi Udaivilas at ₹3.54 Cr for 200 guests, Umaid Bhawan Palace at ₹1.2-3.5 Cr for 150 guests. Goa offers the best value at ₹15-70 lakhs, while Kerala backwater weddings can be done for ₹5-40 lakhs. Among weddings with budgets exceeding ₹1 crore, 60% are destination celebrations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best month for a destination wedding in India?",
      "answer": "October to March is ideal for most Indian destinations, with November-February being peak season. Rajasthan (Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur) sees temperatures of 50-85°F (10-29°C) in winter—perfect for outdoor events. Goa's peak is November-February with dry weather and pleasant 70-85°F temps. Kerala works September-March. Avoid April-June for Rajasthan (temperatures reach 105°F) and June-September for coastal destinations (heavy monsoon). Peak season bookings require 12-18 months advance planning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far in advance should I book a destination wedding venue in India?",
      "answer": "Taj Lake Palace Udaipur, Oberoi Udaivilas, and Umaid Bhawan Palace require 18-24 months advance booking for November-February peak dates. All 83 rooms at Taj Lake Palace and all 89 rooms at Oberoi Udaivilas must be booked together—there's no partial booking option. Goa venues typically need 6-12 months for peak season. Hill station and Kerala venues may accommodate 3-6 months for off-peak dates. Wedding planners with venue relationships often have priority access to in-demand dates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the hidden costs in a destination wedding?",
      "answer": "Hidden costs can add 20-30% to your budget: 18% GST on all venue services, mandatory full-hotel bookings at palace venues (all 83 rooms at Taj Lake Palace = ₹1.6 Cr just for accommodation), boat transfers to island venues (₹50,000-2 lakhs), elephant/royal processions (₹25,000-75,000), generator backup for outdoor events, vendor accommodation and meals, permits for drones/fireworks/late-night events, and photography permits at heritage sites. Goa requires sound licenses and panchayat permissions for beach events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a wedding planner for a destination wedding in India?",
      "answer": "The destination wedding event planning segment is growing at 17.5% CAGR—the fastest in the industry—because professional planning is increasingly essential. Planners charge 10-15% of total budget (vs 20-25% internationally) but save 15-20% through vendor negotiations. They provide: venue access and priority booking, local vendor relationships in 40+ destinations, crisis management, on-ground coordination, and cultural consultation. For international destinations (Thailand, Dubai), planners save 40-50% through established supplier relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does India compare to international destinations for weddings?",
      "answer": "India offers 40-60% savings compared to equivalent European venues. Thailand destination weddings average 10 million baht (~₹2.8 Cr) for 200-500 guests with 40-50% savings vs India. Dubai starts at 450,000 AED (~₹1 Cr) but alcohol costs are high (500 AED/person). Internationally, Thailand and Bali are budget-friendly; Italy and Greece are premium. According to Skyscanner, Thailand, UAE, and Italy are the top international choices for Indian couples. The key advantage of India: no visa coordination, familiar cuisine, and multi-faith ceremony expertise."
