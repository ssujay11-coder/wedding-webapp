Whether you're planning locally or at a destination, this guide keeps you on track.\n\n## Before You Begin: The Foundation (Week 1-2)\n\nBefore diving into vendor meetings and venue tours, establish your foundation:\n\n### Define Your Vision\n\nSpend quality time discussing:\n- What kind of wedding do you envision? (Intimate garden party? Grand ballroom? Destination beach?)\n- What matters most to each of you?\n- What are your non-negotiables?\n- What are you willing to compromise on?\n- What do you NOT want?\n\n### Set Your Budget\n\nThis is the most important conversation you'll have:\n\n1. **Determine available funds**: Your savings + family contributions\n2. **Create realistic expectations**: Research average costs in your area\n3. **Build in buffer**: Add 10-15% contingency for unexpected costs\n4. **Allocate by category**: Use our recommended percentages:\n   - Venue & Catering: 40-45%\n   - Photography & Video: 10-15%\n   - Florals & Decor: 8-12%\n   - Music/Entertainment: 8-10%\n   - Attire: 8-10%\n   - Stationery: 2-3%\n   - Miscellaneous: 5-7%\n   - Contingency: 10-15%\n\n### Create Your Preliminary Guest List\n\nDraft a realistic guest list by tier:\n- **Tier 1**: Must be there (immediate family, closest friends)\n- **Tier 2**: Would love to have (extended family, good friends)\n- **Tier 3**: Nice to include if budget/space allows (acquaintances, coworkers)\n\nYour guest count directly impacts your budget. Every guest adds $100-200 in costs.\n\n### Choose Your Wedding Party\n\nAsk your wedding party early so they can:\n- Save the date\n- Budget for attire and events\n- Be involved in planning if desired\n- Feel honored (not like an afterthought)\n\n## Months 12-10: Dream Big, Decide Smart\n\n### Month 12: Book Your Big Three\n\n**Priority tasks**:\n\n1. **Select and book your venue** (This is your #1 priority)\n   - Tour 3-5 venues\n   - Consider: Capacity, location, season, included amenities, restrictions\n   - Get everything in writing\n   - Understand cancellation policies\n   - Ask about preferred vendor lists vs. outside vendors\n   \n   **Pro tip**: Your venue choice impacts everything else.

Choose what matters most and let go of the rest.\n\n### Use a Planning App\nTools like The Knot, WeddingWire, or Aisle Planner keep everything organized in one place.\n\n### Schedule Regular Planning Sessions\nSet aside time weekly to tackle tasks together. Make it enjoyable with wine and takeout.\n\n### Communicate Openly\nDiscuss budget, priorities, and concerns honestly with your partner throughout the process.\n\n### Take Breaks\nDon't let wedding planning consume your relationship. Have wedding-free date nights.\n\n### Trust Your Vendors\nYou hired them for a reason. Let them do their jobs.\n\n### Don't Sweat Small Stuff\nGuests remember the feeling, food, and fun—not whether your napkins matched the tablecloth exactly.\n\n### Enjoy the Process\nThis is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Find joy in the planning, not just the day.\n\n## Common Timeline Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Mistake #1: Booking venue before setting budget\nYou fall in love and commit before knowing if you can afford the rest.\n\n### Mistake #2: Waiting too long to book key vendors\nTop photographers and popular venues book 12-18 months out.\n\n### Mistake #3: Ordering dress too close to wedding\nDresses take 6-9 months to arrive plus alterations time.\n\n### Mistake #4: Not building in buffer time\nThings take longer than expected. Build cushion into your timeline.\n\n### Mistake #5: Trying to DIY everything\nYour time and sanity are worth something. Hire help for the big stuff.\n\n### Mistake #6: Sending invitations too late\nGuests need time to arrange travel, childcare, and time off work.\n\n### Mistake #7: Leaving seating chart to last minute\nThis takes way longer than you think and requires multiple revisions.\n\n## Your Timeline Toolkit\n\n### Essential Planning Tools\n1. **Shared calendar** (Google Calendar, app-based wedding planner)\n2. **Budget tracker** (Excel, Google Sheets, or wedding app)\n3. **Vendor contact sheet** (all contact info in one place)\n4. **Inspiration boards** (Pinterest, physical binder)\n5. **Checklist apps** (Asana, Trello, wedding-specific apps)\n\n### Create Your Command Center\nDesignate a space in your home for:\n- Binder with all contracts and correspondence\n- Inspiration photos and swatches\n- Guest list and RSVP tracking\n- To-do lists and timelines\n- Budget spreadsheet\n\n### Build Your Support Team\n- Wedding planner or coordinator\n- Trusted family member or friend for questions\n- Wedding party for specific tasks\n- Online communities for ideas and support\n\n## Final Thoughts: Your Timeline, Your Way\n\nWhile this timeline provides structure, remember that every wedding is unique. You might move faster or slower through certain phases. You might skip elements that don't resonate with you. You might add cultural traditions or personal touches not mentioned here.\n\nThe key is having a roadmap so you're never wondering, \"What should I be doing right now?\" or panicking about forgotten tasks.\n\nWedding planning is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourself, stay organized, communicate openly with your partner, and don't forget to actually enjoy being engaged. This is a special time in your life—don't let stress overshadow the joy.\n\nMost importantly, remember what this is all about: celebrating your love and commitment with the people who matter most. Everything else is just details.\n\n---\n\n**Need help staying on track?** Elite Wedding Planner offers comprehensive planning services, partial coordination, and day-of management to keep you organized and stress-free throughout your planning journey.
