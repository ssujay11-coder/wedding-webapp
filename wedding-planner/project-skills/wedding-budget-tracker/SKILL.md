## Budget Tracking Workflow

   - Set realistic total budget

2. **Allocate by Category**
   - Use percentage guidelines
   - Adjust based on priorities
   - Example: Photography lovers allocate 15-20% to photo/video

3. **Research and Estimate**
   - Get quotes from vendors
   - Input estimated costs
   - Note quote expiration dates

4. **Book and Track**
   - Update with actual costs when booked
   - Record deposits paid
   - Track payment due dates

5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Weekly budget review
   - Reallocate if over in one category
   - Identify cost-saving opportunities

6. **Final Reconciliation**
   - Compare estimated vs actual
   - Track final payments
   - Analyze for future reference

## Cost-Saving Strategies

### Venue & Catering
- Off-peak season (November-March, except holidays)
- Friday or Sunday instead of Saturday
- Brunch or lunch instead of dinner
- Weekday wedding
- All-inclusive venues
- Limit bar to beer, wine, signature cocktail
- Buffet instead of plated service

### Photography
- Shorter coverage (6 hours vs 10 hours)
- One photographer instead of two
- Digital files only, no album
- Engagement session as add-on only if budget allows

### Flowers & Decor
- In-season flowers
- Greenery-heavy arrangements
- Repurpose ceremony flowers at reception
- DIY centerpieces
- Fewer statement pieces
- Potted plants as centerpieces (guests take home)

### Attire
- Sample sale dresses
- Rent vs buy
- Accessories from non-bridal retailers
- Bridesmaid dresses in budget-friendly colors/styles

### Invitations
- Digital save-the-dates
- Single-card invitations (vs multiple inserts)
- Printable designs (print yourself)
- Simple online RSVP (no physical card)

### Music
- DJ vs live band
- Spotify playlist for cocktail hour
- Friend/family as ceremony musician

### Cake/Desserts
- Smaller display cake, sheet cake for serving
- Dessert bar instead of traditional cake
- Grocery store bakery (surprisingly good!)
- Cupcakes or donuts

### General Strategies
- Smaller guest list = biggest savings
- DIY decorations and favors
- Borrow vs buy (card box, unity candle, etc.)
- Digital programs instead of printed
- Prioritize what matters most, cut what doesn't

## Budget Adjustment Calculator

When one category goes over:

```
Original Budget: $30,000
Venue went over by: $2,000
New Total Budget: $32,000

Options:
1. Increase overall budget by $2,000
2. Reduce other categories by $2,000 total
   Suggestion: Cut $500 from flowers, $500 from favors,
   $500 from invitations, $500 from miscellaneous

3. Reduce guest count to bring cost per guest in line
   Original: 100 guests at $300/guest
   New: 93 guests at $300/guest saves $2,100
```
