- Separate divorced parents if needed

**3. VIP Guests**

**By Interest/Connection**:
- Hiking enthusiasts
- Book club members
- Neighbors
- Mutual friends

### Seating Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Divorced parents**
**Solution**:
- Seat at separate tables, both near couple
- Each with their current partners
- Both tables equally honored (equidistant)

**Challenge: Guests who don't know anyone**
**Solution**:
- Pair with outgoing, friendly guests
- Seat near couple's close friends (who will be welcoming)
- Brief couple's friends to include them

**Challenge: Family feuds**
**Solution**:
- Opposite sides of room
- Different sight lines
- Brief wedding party to monitor
- Buffer tables between them

**Challenge: Kids table**
**Solution**:
- Near parents but not right next to
- Activities/coloring books provided
- Assign responsible older cousin to help
- Consider no kids option for very formal weddings

**Challenge: Plus-ones who don't know couple**
**Solution**:
- Seat with their date (obviously)
- Table with other friendly couples
- Near dance floor for easy mingling

**Challenge: Odd numbers**
- Better to have 7 at an 8-person table than squeeze 11 at 10-person
- Use smaller cocktail tables for groups of 3-5
- VIP table of 7 is fine

Tables needed: 120 ÷ 10 = 12 tables
Plus head table for 8 = 13 total tables
```
