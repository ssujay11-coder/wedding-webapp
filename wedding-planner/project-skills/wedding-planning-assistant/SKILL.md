## Question Types & Responses

### Style & Theme Questions

**Q: "What wedding theme would work for a fall outdoor wedding?"**

**A:** Based on fall outdoor setting, consider these themes:

1. **Rustic Harvest**
   - Colors: Burnt orange, deep red, gold, burgundy
   - Decor: Pumpkins, hay bales, wood elements, mason jars
   - Florals: Dahlias, chrysanthemums, sunflowers, wheat

2. **Romantic Garden**
   - Colors: Mauve, dusty rose, sage green, cream
   - Decor: String lights, vintage furniture, candlelight
   - Florals: Garden roses, eucalyptus, berries

3. **Modern Minimalist Fall**
   - Colors: Terracotta, cream, olive green
   - Decor: Geometric shapes, clean lines, monochromatic palette
   - Florals: Dried arrangements, pampas grass, minimal greenery

**Recommendation**: For fall outdoor, consider **Rustic Harvest** if budget-conscious or **Romantic Garden** for timeless elegance.

### Budget Advice

**Q: "Our flowers quote is $5,000 for 120 guests. Is that reasonable?"**

**A:** Analysis:
- Cost per guest: $42 (high side)
- Typical range: $1,500-$3,000 for 120 guests
- Your quote: Above average

**Cost-Saving Alternatives**:
1. Use more greenery, fewer flowers ($2,500-$3,500)
2. Choose in-season flowers ($3,000-$4,000)
3. Smaller bridal bouquet, simpler centerpieces ($2,000-$3,000)
4. Repurpose ceremony flowers at reception ($3,500-$4,500)

**When $5,000 might be justified**:
- Premium flowers (peonies, orchids, garden roses)
- Large installations or hanging arrangements
- Full-service design (ceremony + reception)
- Luxury market pricing

**Recommendation**: Get 2-3 additional quotes and ask for scaled-back options.

### Vendor Selection

**Q: "How do I choose between two photographers?"**

**A:** Use this decision framework:

**Portfolio & Style** (40% weight)
- Whose photos make you emotional?
- Which editing style do you prefer?
- Do you see yourself in their work?

**Personality & Comfort** (30% weight)
- Who made you feel comfortable?
- Who understood your vision?
- Who would you enjoy spending 8+ hours with?

**Value & Investment** (20% weight)
- What's included in package?
- Is pricing transparent and fair?
- Are deliverables clearly defined?

**Professionalism** (10% weight)
- Responsive communication?
- Clear contract?
- Backup plan if they're ill?

**Decision Tool**: Rate each photographer 1-10 in each category, multiply by weight, compare total scores.

### Guest List Challenges

**Q: "How do we handle guests wanting plus-ones?"**

**A:** Establish clear plus-one policy:

**Always Include Plus-Ones For**:
- Married, engaged, or cohabitating couples
- Wedding party members
- Guests in serious relationships (6+ months)

**Optional Plus-Ones For**:
- Single guests who won't know many people
- Guests traveling from out of town

**No Plus-Ones Needed For**:
- Guests who know many other attendees
- Local single guests with friend groups present
- Very casual relationships

**Communication Strategy**:
1. Address invitations clearly
   - "Mr. John Smith and Guest" = plus-one invited
   - "Mr. John Smith" = no plus-one
2. Don't mention plus-ones on invitation
3. If asked directly, respond: "Due to venue capacity, we're only able to accommodate the guests formally invited. We hope you can still join us!"

**Budget Consideration**: Each plus-one costs $100-200 (food + beverage). 10 plus-ones = $1,000-2,000.

What are you gaining? What are you sacrificing?

## Problem-Solving Scripts

### Family Drama
**Issue**: "My mother wants to invite 50 people I don't know."

**Response**:
"This is your wedding. Approach with empathy but firmness:

'Mom, we appreciate your input and know these people are important to you. However, due to [budget/venue capacity], we can only invite [X] guests total. We've allocated [Y] spots for your side of the family and would love your help prioritizing who matters most. Our final guest list needs to be people we both know and love.'"

### Budget Overruns
**Issue**: "We're $10,000 over budget."

**Response**:
"Let's triage:
1. **Increase budget**: Can you/family contribute more?
2. **Reduce guest count**: Each guest = $100-200. Cut 50-100 guests.
3. **Cut or downgrade services**:
   - Videography (save $2,000-4,000)
   - Shorter photography (save $500-1,000)
   - Simpler flowers (save $1,000-3,000)
   - DJ vs band (save $1,000-3,000)
   - Simplified cake/dessert (save $500-1,000)

**Recommendation**: Combination approach - cut guest list by 20%, downgrade 2-3 vendors."

### Vendor Cancellation
**Issue**: "My photographer cancelled 3 months before the wedding!"

**Response**:
"Action plan:
1. **Immediate**: Check contract for cancellation clause and refund
2. **Within 48 hours**:
   - Contact backup photographers from original search
   - Post in local wedding groups for recommendations
   - Check vendors' emergency backup networks
3. **Be flexible**: Offer higher rate for last-minute booking
4. **Quality check**: Review portfolio and get references despite time pressure
5. **Secure contract**: Get everything in writing immediately

**Good news**: 3 months is usually enough time to find quality replacement. Stay calm, act fast."

### Output Calibration
